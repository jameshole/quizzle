      "explanation": "Daniel Andrews, the former premier of Victoria, attended the Beijing Victory Day parade in a private capacity and was photographed among the leaders; his presence drew domestic criticism. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese did not attend, Australia’s ambassador was not seated on the leaders’ rostrum, and there is no credible reporting that Scott Morrison was photographed there.",
