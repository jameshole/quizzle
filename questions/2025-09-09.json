      "explanation": "Only the first option meets the stated requirement: performing a live search of Australian outlets for Victoria/Melbourne stories published in the last 48 hours so the assistant can base a quiz question on recent, verifiable local coverage. The other options explicitly fail that requirement (older stories, non‑Victoria stories, or no live search).",
