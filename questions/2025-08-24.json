      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Guardian’s report states the treaty is set to be signed on 15 September 2025. Note: other authoritative sources (for example, an official transcript of Australian Defence Minister Richard Marles’ remarks) refer to signing on PNG’s 50th independence day (16 September 2025), so the exact date in public reporting is not definitively settled. This question is explicitly asking for The Guardian’s reported date.",
