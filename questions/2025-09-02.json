      "explanation": "At the Sept. 1, 2025 SCO summit in Tianjin, Xi Jinping promoted a “Global Governance Initiative” and called for creation of an SCO development bank (with follow-up pledges of Chinese support). He did not propose forming a NATO‑style alliance, did not pledge to withdraw China from the UN, and did not propose ending BeiDou access for SCO partners (reports say he encouraged BeiDou cooperation). Note: reporting indicates the GGI was proposed/promoted rather than finalized with full implementation details.",
