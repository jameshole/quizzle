      "explanation": "Reporting from Aug. 18–19, 2025 indicates Trump said the U.S. would help provide security guarantees for Ukraine but would not put “American boots on the ground” — a public assurance given in follow-up remarks (Aug. 19) after the Aug. 18 meeting. The other options (immediate brigade deployment, U.S. ground NATO peacekeepers, permanent stationing of U.S. trainers/combat troops in eastern Ukraine) did not occur and were not announced in the cited reporting.",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Santos told investors it “does not expect the parties to enter into a binding SIA by Friday 22 August 2025,” meaning the ADNOC‑led consortium would not be able to finalise the takeover by Aug. 22, 2025. Aug. 25, 2025 is the date Santos deferred its interim results to and is not the takeover finalisation deadline; Sept. 22 and Aug. 18 were not cited as deadlines in the announcement.",
